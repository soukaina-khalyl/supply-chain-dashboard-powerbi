Power BI project analyzing logistics and supply chain KPIs.
# ðŸšš Supply Chain Dashboard in Power BI

This project is an end-to-end Power BI dashboard built using logistics and supply chain data. It includes data cleaning, transformation, KPI definition, DAX measures, and interactive visualizations.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To simulate the responsibilities of a data analyst in a logistics/supply chain environment by tracking key metrics such as shipping cost, order volume, lead time, and regional performance.

## ðŸ”„ Project Workflow

1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - Imported Excel dataset from supply chain sample (linked in tutorial).
   - Cleaned missing values and renamed columns using Power Query.

2. **Data Modeling**
   - Established relationships between fact and dimension tables.
   - Created a star schema for optimized reporting.

3. **DAX Measures**

   - Cost per Region, Orders by Status

4. **Dashboard Design**
   - KPIs at top: Total Orders, Average Cost, Delayed Shipments
   - Bar and line charts for region-wise and product-wise performance
   - Slicers for filtering by Region, Product Type, and Time

5. **Insights**
   - Identified regions with higher shipping costs
   - Highlighted delays in a specific product category
   - Recommended actions based on capacity trends
